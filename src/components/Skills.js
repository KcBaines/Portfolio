          In August 2024, I successfully completed an intensive Full-Stack Web
          Development Bootcamp. Throughout this course, I gained hands-on
          experience with technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React,
          Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. From front-end design to back-end
          development and database management, I’ve built a solid foundation in
          creating full-stack web applications. This journey taught me the
          importance of problem-solving, collaboration, and attention to detail.
          I developed real-world projects that honed my ability to translate
          ideas into functional, user-friendly solutions. I am now eager to
          apply these skills in a professional setting. I’m looking for an
          opportunity to prove my capabilities, contribute to impactful
          projects, and continue growing as a developer. If you're a company
          looking for someone passionate about technology, committed to
          learning, and ready to take on challenges, I’d love the chance to work
          with you.
